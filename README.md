# Web application

## Requirements

- Node 22
- NPM
- Docker

## Quick start

### Install dependencies

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Create an .env file <a name=".env"></a>

Create an file named `.env`, then add these variables :

```bash
# If you're using Linux, your local (or distant) hasura endpoint url should looks like this :
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_API_BEARER_TOKEN=Bearer key

## HASURA
SKILLZ_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET={"type": "RS512", "key": "{your-certificate}"}
HASURA_ACHIEVEMENTS_ENDPOINT=http://172.17.0.1:3000/api/achievement
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET=key

## AUTH0
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CONNECTION=google-oauth2
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CALLBACK=/auth
```

### Run postgres and hasura locally with docker <a name="postgres"></a>

Start by running `docker compose up -d` to launch the postgres database and the hasura graphql-engine.

Check that engine is running by going to `http://localhost:8080` (do not modify schemas through this URL).

### Run the hasura migrations <a name="hasuramigrations"></a>

In order to initialize / update the database run :

```bash
# Sets up the schema
npm run hasura migrate apply

# Sets up GraphQL
npm run hasura metadata apply

# Optional : seeds/cleans up the database with referential data
npm run hasura seed apply
```

### Develop with hasura

For hasura to to keep track of schema changes in the hasura/migrations folder and generate the migration files properly the hasura console must be run apart from the "in-app" hasura engine
and console.

```bash
# Runs in another console
npm run hasura console
```

### Run the app

```bash
# Runs in another console
npm run dev
```

The application should be available at the URL specified in your .env file under `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

## Tests

### Unit tests

Run the following command :

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### 2E2 Tests

Before running cypress tests, all data from the test user should be deleted.

Create a file named `.env.test`, with the same content as the .env.
Replace the value of the variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CONNECTION` with `Username-Password-Authentication`

Create a file named `cypress.env.json` at the root of the project with the following content :

```json
{
  "test_username": "",
  "test_password": ""
}
```

In order to run all tests :

```bash
# start the webapp
npm run build:e2e
npm run start:e2e
## or
NODE_ENV=test npm run dev

# start cypress tests
npm run cypress:run
## or with ui
npm run cypress:open
```
